# VDIC
Virtual Dynamic ID Card

VDIC is a tag which we will be providing to every community member of e-DAM.

This is a Business Card, ID Card, and A Key to many places.

Validation - 
  We will be getting Industrial Mentors, and We will come up with a set of Rules and Regulations which a person has to complete to go up the ladder.
  We will brainstorm more ideas, to automate the validation process.
  
Advantages to Community Members
1. A Tag which will keep you under a spotlight and describe you technology knowledge and experience through a card.

Advantages to Hackathon/Start-ups/HRs/Students/Colleges
1. Save time, energey and resources when a Hackathon is trying to verify is a student knows the technology to participate in the hackathon.
2. Save time, energey and resources when a Start-Up/Company is trying to Hire students as Interns/Full time.
3. As these tags are out there, we will recognise the number of developer/designers/tech enthusiasts around themselves, without spending alot of time.

Credibility - 
1. Industrial Mentors will be validating the levels of CMs.
2. Partnerships with other organisations and taking their support in using VDIC as a key to events/conferences/short-cut.
Need to brainstorm more ideas.

This card will be available in Soft Copy, Hard Copy, and as a URL.
